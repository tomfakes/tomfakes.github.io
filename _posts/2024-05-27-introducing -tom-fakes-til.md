title: Introducing My TIL Blog
---

In my travels as a Software Engineer, there are many times where I learn something new.  Some of these things could
warrant a full blog post going into many details, with code examples etc.  But there are lots of times where maybe a simple,
short, post that picks out a detail that could help othere, or my future self, without reading through someone's life story.

This is my version of that Thing I Learned - TIL - blog.

This is hosted on Github Pages, with the Jekyll theme called Hyde.  The beauty of the Github Pages system is that it uses all
the tooling I use daily anyway.  Either using an editor for files on my local disk, or editing those files directly in Github, 
allows for quickly adding new posts with little ceremony.
